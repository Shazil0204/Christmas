# Christmas

this is just a simple "HTML & CSS & JAVASCRIPT" program that will checks if the user input month name 

if the insert text is december then it play music and shows "Gl√¶delig jul"

if the insert text is other another month than it shows "Bare det snart var jul"

and if the insert text is not a month then it shows "Navn eksisterer ikke"

i am using bootstrap 5 with it and have insert christmas lighting on the index page
